# hello-world
My very first GitHub repository

Hi Everyone! 

My name is Katherine and I am currently a Writer and Producer. I've recently begun taking more Responsive Web Design and Python classes. It has been interesting thus far. I am intrigued by the creative possibilities. I look forward to working with you all!
